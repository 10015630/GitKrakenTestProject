	/* Comment Partner A
		I learned that Git Kraken is a software that makes Git commands and processes easy, fast, and intuitive, allows for more fluid workflows. 
		It allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project which allows a team of programmers to complete the different parts of the same assignment by
		merging the parts to create one file.
